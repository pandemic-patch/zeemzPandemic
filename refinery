# Idea Refinery

"The idea is to create an in-game map showing infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, dorms, shelters, trailer-parks, etc. Then we will add infected residents who can be classified into critical, emergent, non-emergent. We should then add the ability to move the infected residents into the infrastructures in the map in-game according to where they can be properly treated for the infection."
