## Pandemic Patch - Augmented Reality Game to Identify & Patch COVID-19 Problems

Today, hospitals around the world are experiencing surge issues as the number of patients overwhelms the available beds. Supply and staff shortages are adding to the crisis. Our global health system needs a patch. We propose a gamified approach to hospital congestion that teaches and rewards the players for taking localized actions to help prevent hospital congestion in their locations. 

To reach the goal of building a POC in days, we're adapting [ZEEMZ: Quicksand Faucet](https://faucet.zeemz.xyz), a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure cryptocurrency faucet, into [ZEEMZ: Pandemic Patch Faucet](https://faucet.zeemz.xyz/pandemicpatch/index.html). In this scenario, a virus gets into the players atmosuit, the player is immediately informed, and given four choices each of which will trigger consequences (rewards/fines). Every consequence will also include information on improving the player's responses in an emergency.

**Choices**
1. panic
2. not panic, ignore warning, continue with mission, return to base when done
3. not panic, return to base, report incident
4. not panic, remain isolated, report incident

**Consequences**
1. panic - 1 fine, panicker 
2. not panic - 1/4 reward, 3/4 fine, superspreader
3. not panic - 1/2 reward, 1/2 fine, spreader
4. not panic - 1 reward, self-isolator

**Information**
1. Triggers panicker with tips to prevent & to reduce panic
2. Triggers superspreader simulation with steps like heeding warnings, frequent handwashing, etc
3. Triggers spreader simulation with steps like social distancing, online communications, etc
4. Triggers self-isolator with tips to make isolation

"The lack of specific treatment for COVID-19 should be emphasized—patients should stay home and use usual over-the-counter fever control and decongestion medications unless or until their symptoms are severe enough to require hospitalization. Information on “red flag” symptoms or signs should be developed to facilitate patient decision making and the use of call lines to help with decision making should be implemented."

### 1st Game Goal: Reduce Strain on Hospital Systems
*Hospital Congestion - South Korea method from NY Times article (see below)*<br />
1. intervene before catastrophe<br /> 
2. test frequently and safely<br />
3. contact tracing, isolation, and monitoring<br />
4. public alerts (including info about contact tracing), public help, consistent government messaging 

### Further Refining
"The idea is to create an in-game map showing infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, dorms, shelters, trailer-parks, etc. Then we will add infected residents who can be classified into critical, emergent, non-emergent. We should then add the ability to move the infected residents into the infrastructures in the map in-game according to where they can be properly treated for the infection."

A Series of if-thens (simulation of spread)
1. if monitoring situation checks good, then dissemination of information is possible, otherwise error (more virus)
2. if contact tracing checks good, then insure isolation & quarantine, otherwise error (more virus)
3. if continues contact tracing checks good, then continue isolation & quarantine, otherwise error (more virus)
4. coming soon
