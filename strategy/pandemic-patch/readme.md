# Pandemic Patch - Augmented Reality Game to Identify & Patch COVID-19 Problems
## 1st Game Goal: Reduce Strain on Hospital Systems
*Prevent Hospital Congestion*<br />
1. intervene before catastrophe<br />
2. test frequently and safely<br />
3. contact tracing, isolation, and monitoring<br />
4. public alerts (including info about contact tracing), public help, consistent government messaging 

### Potential issues with mass adoption include: 
1. privacy rights - USA medical privacy rights could prevent public alerts as detailed as S. Korea's, though anonymized data could minimize the privacy rights issues<br />
2. costs of tests - USA requires the citizens to pay for tests, S. Korea has national health & special rules for COVID tests<br />
3. will of governments - slow-acting without consistent direction for citizenry vs. immediate action with consistent direction<br />
4. will of citizenry - threat of outbreak must be taken seriously; however, homelessness kills which is why low income workers go to work sick - how to balance?<br />

## Situation Brief: COVID-19 causes Hospital Congestion
Problem: rapid spread of COVID-19 means influx of patients in hospitals
Solution: teach kids/people about hospitals, hospital limitations, home remedies (for minor ailments), encourage hygiene/sanitation as prevention AND do it in an augmented reality game BECAUSE preventing hospital congestion right now has real meaning
